> A program that will automatically open boxes in Tapps evolution simulator games.

## What you need

### Option 1

- A mobile phone with android 5.0+
- A computer that can run [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy)
  - With [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the following 2 library's:
  - PyAutoGUI
  - opencv-python

### Option 2

- A computer capable of running any android emulator.
- The computer must also have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed with the following 2 library's:
  - PyAutoGUI
  - opencv-python

## What does it do exactly and how to run it?

- IMPORTANT: if you run the bot in your Onedrive you will need to replace the relative paths of the images in `bot.py` with absolute paths! otherwise the bot will simply not work.

1. To run the program you'll need to download the code and extract it into an empty folder.
2. Then mirror your screen to your computer using scrcpy or open your android emulator with one of Tapps games evolution games.
3. Run the `bot.py` file in the folder you extracted the files into.

### IDEA'S

- Make it so program automatically gives to the alien. But I have not figured out how.
